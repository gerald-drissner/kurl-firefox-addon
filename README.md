## About YOURLS (Your Own URL Shortener)

YOURLS is a free, open-source set of PHP scripts that allows you to run your own URL shortening service. Unlike commercial services, YOURLS gives you full control over your data, with powerful features like detailed statistics, link management, and a plugin architecture to extend its functionality.

This Firefox add-on requires you to have your own YOURLS instance already installed and running on a web server.

### How to Install YOURLS

Self-hosting YOURLS requires a web server with PHP and a MySQL database. The general steps are:
1.  Download the latest version of YOURLS from their official website.
2.  Unzip the files and upload them to your web server.
3.  Create a MySQL database and a user for it.
4.  Configure the `config.php` file with your database details, site URL, and a secure signature token.
5.  Run the installation script by navigating to `http://your-domain.com/admin/` in your browser.

For complete and detailed instructions, please refer to the official guide:
**[Official YOURLS Installation Guide](https://yourls.org/#Install)**

### Finding Your API Signature Token

To connect this add-on to your YOURLS instance, you need your unique API signature token.
1.  Log in to your YOURLS admin dashboard (e.g., `http://your-domain.com/admin/`).
2.  In the top menu, click on **Tools**.
3.  At the very top of the Tools page, you will find a section titled **"Secure passwordless API call"**. Your API signature token is the long string of characters displayed there.
